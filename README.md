# WiFi-Based-DHT11-Sensor-Data-Logger-to-ThingSpeak-Using-ESP32
This project demonstrates how to connect an ESP32 microcontroller to a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor and send the collected data to ThingSpeak over Wi-Fi. The code reads temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit, as well as humidity, and uploads these values to specific ThingSpeak fields using an HTTP GET request.
